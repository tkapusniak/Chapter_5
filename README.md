Solutions to the problems from Chapter 5

For rthis one, simply add your solutions to the repository.  There aren't really any sources necessary.

Here is a breakdown of the assignments:

1. Create a program that prints a list of words in random order.
The program should print all the words and not repeat any.

2. Write a Character Creator program for a role-playing game. The
player should be given a pool of 30 points to spend on four
attributes: Strength, Health, Wisdom, and Dexterity. The
player should be able to spend points from the pool on any
attribute and should also be able to take points from an
attribute and put them back into the pool.

3. Write a Who’s Your Daddy? program that lets the user enter
the name of a male and produces the name of his father. (You
can use celebrities, fictional characters, or even historical
figures for fun.) Allow the user to add, replace, and delete sonfather
pairs.

4. Improve the Who’s Your Daddy program by adding a choice that
lets the user enter a name and get back a grandfather. Your
program should still only use one dictionary of son-father
pairs. Make sure to include several generations in your
dictionary so that a match can be found.
